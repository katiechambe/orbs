This repo contains software to pull orbital data from the large volume Cosmological Simulation IllustrisTNG. 

The developed code is part of an ongoing research project, and as such is not in its final state. Documentation and development are still ongoing (as of Winter 2023).

A more detailed readme for usage instructions is coming soon.
