General notes:

RG 2019 looked at the simulated morphology of illustristng galaxies and found that for M*<1e9.5, the morphologies are "less reliable" -> motivates using pair fractions for merger rate studies 

Further work that would be nice to do would be to see if all the timescale stuff stays the same for minor mergers, and for smaller bins from 1-1:4

O'Leary 2021 merging systems can be missed if you don't use wide enough sep criteria, thus leading to under predict merger rate
Jiang 2008 for all things about the "Chandra" timescale for merging galaxies which scales with rc/Vc and is thus prop to the age of the universe (eq. 4\&5). Also quantified the circularity of orbits as a function of mass ratio.

    What's the connection:
    Other notes: 
    Empirical models (EMERGE) to probe the dependencies of pair merging probabilities and merging timescales. Also show that some commonly used pair selection criteria may not represent a suitable sample of galaxies to reproduce underlying merger rates. Seem to talk about both observation timescales and merger timescales, and I'm not sure which one they focus on.
    Quantified probability of a "close pair" merging before z=0 and dependence on rsep-proj, LOS vel, and z. 
    On what timescale will an observed pair merge, and for how long is that pair observable given the selection criteria. 
    What determines pair observation timescales (might be a followup from their 2020 paper) 
    Notes that papers that attempt to come up with fitting functions for timescales etc. will all be wrong for pairs w different selection criteria.
    -> Maybe motivates that we should say that future extensions of our work may lead to the development of fitting functions that can be applied to any system? (is this true?)

    Paper: Towards a consistent framework of comparing galaxy mergers in observations and simulations
    What's the connection: Looked at the major merger fraction of stuff at low-z. Their stellar mass criteria did not cover our range of interest for low-mass systems
    Other notes: Mass dependence of the galaxy major merger fraction at low z. Make synthetic training images from TNG and apply to KiDS images from GAMA. Find that major merger fraction decreases slightly with increasing stellar mass (1e9.5-1e11.5) -> 
    major mergers defined as happening in the next 1Gyr or in the previous 500Myr.
