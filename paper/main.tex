\begin{abstract}
% Statement
Evolutionary differences between low-mass ($\rm 10^8<M_*<5\times10^9\,\Msun$) and high-mass ($\rm 5\times10^9<M_*<10^{11}\,\Msun$) galaxy pairs have been studied in detail for the last few decades, with studies finding differences in star formation rates, gas fractions, and dark matter halo profiles. 
% Problem 
Pair fraction, merger fraction, and merger rate studies of high-mass pairs have been studied extensively, both observationally and theoretically. 
However, it is unclear if using the same separation criteria to select low-mass galaxy pairs for such studies, or if using the same separation criteria at different redshifts, permits an equitable comparison between galaxies of different mass and redshift. 
% Our solution
Here, we present a physically-motivated framework by which merger timescales for high-mass and low-mass pairs can be compared equivalently 
%and converted from one system to another 
by scaling by the virial radius of the primary's FoF group halo ($r_{\mathrm{sep}}< 1 R_{\rm vir}$). 
We use the Illustris TNG100 simulation to quantify the merger timescales of isolated low-mass major pairs as a function of cosmic time, and compare to the merger timescales of similarly-selected high-mass major pairs. 
Using our framework to select pairs via a scaled separation criterion leads to equivalent merger timescales for low- and high-mass systems at redshifts $z=0-6$. 
% What are the timescales? 
Alternatively, static physical separation selections applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs at all redshifts, particularly for the closest pairs ($\rsep<150\kpc$), leads to timescales that differ by up to $\sim1\Gyr$ between low- and high-mass pairs. 
% Why it matters 
Our findings suggest that the comparison of low-mass and high-mass galaxy pair fractions, merger timescales, and merger rates is self-consistent using separation criteria that scales as a function of mass and redshift of the system. 
As a result, applying the same merger timescales to different mass systems will lead to a bias that systematically (over/under) predicts low-mass galaxy merger rates.

%%% OUTLINE
\section{Methodology}
%recap last paper and mention which data sample we narrow down to (low mass major pairs only) -- give examples of orbits
We utilize the group catalogs, produced by the \texttt{SUBFIND} algorithm~\citep{Springel2001,Dolag2009}, and the merger tree catalogs, generated by the \texttt{SUBLINK} algorithm~\citep{RG2015}, from the highest resolution run of the IllustrisTNG simulation TNG100-1 (hereafter TNG100) to study the merger timescales of galaxy pairs from $z=0-6$.
The catalogs consist of a set of 100 snapshots, ranging from $z\sim20$ (snapshot 0) to $z=0$ (snapshot 99).

Our sample consists of major (stellar mass ratio $\M_{*2}/M_{*1}= 1/4 - 1$) low-mass and high-mass pairs that are isolated but physically associated.
From this sample, we will determine the fraction of pairs at each snapshot that merge before $z=0$, and track the orbits of the subhalos of each pair to study their merger timescales.

\subsection{Pair sample}
We begin with an extension of the \paircat{} described in ~\citet{Chamberlain2024}, which consists of a collection of isolated subhalo pairs at each snapshot in TNG100. 
Rather than only considering pairs for $z<4$, we will collect our base sample at each redshift in the simulation (from $z=0-\sim 27$). 
A brief version of the selection routine is transcribed here for completeness, and note that more detail and discussion of the choices for selection criteria are in Sec.~2 of~\citet{Chamberlain2024}. 

At each snapshot, low-mass and high-mass pairs are chosen by first selecting the two most massive halos (by stellar mass) from FoF groups with virial mass\footnote{We use \texttt{Group\_M\_TopHat200} from the TNG100 Group Catalogs as the FoF Group virial mass. This mass is defined to be the mass enclosed by a sphere with mean density $\Delta_c *\rho_c$, where $\Delta_c$ is the overdensity constant from~\citet{Brynorman1998} and $\rho_c$ is the critical density of the universe at the time calculated. The corresponding virial radius in TNG100 is given by \texttt{Group\_R\_TopHat200}.} 
\begin{align*}
        \mbox{\textbf{low mass:}}&\,\rm M_{G} = 8\times 10^{10}- 5\times 10^{11}\,\Msun \\ 
        \mbox{\textbf{high mass:}}&\, \rm M_{G}=1\times 10^{12}- 6.5\times10^{12}\,\Msun.
\end{align*}
Utilizing the most massive subhalos from the same FoF group ensures that the pairs are isolated from other massive nearby systems that could perturb the dynamical state of the pair. 

We require that subhalos constituting a pair meet a minimum subhalo mass criteria of 
\begin{equation*}
    \mbox{\textbf{minimum subhalo mass:}}\,
    \Mhalo > 1\times10^{9}\Msun.
\end{equation*}
at the snapshot of consideration. 
For each halo in the FoF group that passes the minimum subhalo mass criteria, we utilize the \texttt{SUBLINK} catalogs to trace their mass history~\citep{RG2015}, and find the peak halo mass of each subhalo. 

Stellar masses are then assigned to each subhalo in the FoF group using the abundance matching prescription of \citet{Moster2013}. 
The peak halo mass and current redshift are used to calculate the stellar mass of each subhalo, so that the abundance matching prescription is of the form $\ms{}=f(\Mpeak,z)$, with $z$ the redshift of consideration.

In \citet{Chamberlain2024}, the abundance matching prescription was sampled 1000 times for each subhalo to account for the spread in the Stellar Mass -- Halo Mass relation. 
However, for the purposes of the present study, we only use the stellar masses given by the median of the abundance matching relationship. 
This choice permits a roughly 1:1 monotonic relationship between stellar mass and peak halo mass, so that taking subsamples of the lowest stellar mass objects will result in a subsample with lower peak halo mass as well. % is this a good enough reason? 
Additionally, ~\cite{Chamberlain2024} found that the spread in the number of pairs selected at a given redshift is small, such that we expect the spread on the timescale analysis to be dominated by the redshift spacing of the simulation. 

Primary halos are defined as the subhalo with the highest stellar mass ($M_{*1}$) in their FoF group, and secondaries are defined as the second most massive subhalo with stellar mass $M_{*2}$. 
Our sample of major pairs then consists of all pairs of primary and secondary halos with 
\begin{align*} 
\mbox{\textbf{low mass primaries:}}&\, 10^{8}< \rm M_{*1} < 5\times10^{9} \Msun \\ 
\mbox{\textbf{high mass primaries:}}&\, 5\times 10^{9}< \rm M_{*1} < 10^{11} \Msun\\
\mbox{\textbf{stellar mass ratio:}}&\,      
    M_{*2}/M_{*1} > 1/4.
\end{align*}
A primary or secondary halo can only be a member of one single pair at a given snapshot, such that a collection of $N$ pairs consists of $N$ unique primaries and $N$ unique secondaries.

% i am removing the 10kpc component of this because I think it'd just be easier to handle those cases in the 
% Finally, we will only consider pairs that have physical separations of $\rsep>10\,\kpc$ at the snapshot of selection. 
% The physical separation cut does not vary with redshift, and is the same for both low-mass and high-mass pairs. 

The base sample of pairs used for this analysis then consists of the set of all low-mass and high-mass major pairs from each redshift of the TNG100 simulation. 


\subsection{Mergers}
% Plot \#1: Merger fraction either before or after orbits
% Note that it is very interesting that dwarf pairs in the field have high merger fractions, while the likelihood of merger is very low in more dense environments (add citation).

The primary and secondary subhalos of each pair have a `SubfindID' that is used to identify them in the \texttt{Subfind} merger tree catalogs, which contain information about every FoF group and subhalo at each redshift. 
The \texttt{SUBLINK} catalogs track subhalos from one redshift to the next, and thus enable us to track subhalos both backwards and forwards in time from any given redshift. 

We utilize the \texttt{DescendantID} field of the \texttt{SUBLINK} catalogs to determine which pairs from our base sample merge before the end of the simulation (at $z=0$) and when the merger occurs. 
The \texttt{DescendantID} field provides the `SubhaloID'\footnote{Note that the `SubhaloID' is distinct from the `SubfindID', and is unique for every subhalo in the merger trees. 
The \texttt{SUBLINK} catalogs provide the associated `SubfindID' of each subhalo.} of the subhalo's descendent in the next (or one of the following) snapshot, if it has one. 
% By following the \texttt{DescendantID}, you follow a subhalo through all of it's mergers to the `root' of the merger tree.  

A pair will be classified as a merger if the primary and secondary subhalo share the same \texttt{DescendantID} at the same redshift. 
This means that the primary and secondary subhalo will merge, producing a single descendant subhalo, by the following redshift from the simulation.
If a pair consists of a primary and secondary that never share a \texttt{DescendantID} at a given redshift, the pair is defined as a `non-merger.'

For each merging pair, we define the `merger redshift' as the redshift that immediately follows the first snapshot where the primary and secondary have the same \texttt{DescendantID}. 
For example, if the primary and secondary have different \texttt{DescendantIDs} from $z=6$ to $z=2$, but have the same \texttt{DescendantID} at $z=2$, then the merger must take place some time between $z=2$ and $z=1.9$, which is the next redshift in the simulation. 
We take $z=1.9$ to be the merger redshift. 

\subsection{Orbits} 
\begin{figure}[tb]

    \label{fig:example-orbits}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We extract orbits for all mergers and non-mergers in our base pair sample. 
An orbit for a single pair is defined to be the physical separation between the primary and secondary subhalo as a function of redshift (or lookback time). 

A given pair from the base sample at redshift $z_n$, which by definition passes all selection criteria at $z_n$, can be followed backwards and forwards in time using the \texttt{SUBLINK} merger trees.  
We track the positions of both the primary and secondary subhalo at each redshift and calculate the physical separations after accounting for the periodic boundary conditions of the simulation box.
In cases where the primary or secondary does not have a defined position at a given redshift, we set the separation at that snapshot to NaN.\footnote{If a subhalo is very small, or is passing through a more massive subhalo, and is unable to reach the density contrast required to be identified as an independent structure by the Subfind algorithm, it will not have a defined position in the Sublink catalogs. The sublink algorithm allows for subhalos to skip a single snapshot, and identifies the `skipped descendent' in the $S_{n+2}$ snapshot, so that the orbit can be evaluated before and after the skip occurs. See Sec.~3 in ~\citet{RG2015} for more details.}

In addition to the physical separation, we also calculate the scaled separation of a pair at each snapshot. We use the definition of scaled separation from~\cite{Chamberlain2024}, where the physical separation is written instead as a fraction of the virial radius $\rsep=X\Rvir$
% \begin{equation}
%     \rm \Rsc = \frac{\rsep}{\Rvir}
% \end{equation}
where $\rsep$ is the physical separation in $\kpc$, and $\Rvir$ is the virial radius of the primary's FoF group, which reasonably approximates the virial radius of a halo with a virial mass equal to the combined subhalo mass of the primary and secondary.
This ``scaled radius" is, by construction, a function of mass and redshift, which will account for the mass difference between low-mass and high-mass pairs and for halo growth over time. 

We collect the following data for each pair at each redshift where the primary and secondary are both defined: the virial mass of the primary's FoF group \texttt{Group\_M\_TopHat200}, the virial radius of the primary's FoF group \texttt{Group\_R\_TopHat200}, the physical separation (in $\kpc$), and the scaled separation (dimensionless).

\subsubsection{Defining Post-Infall}
While the orbit of a pair may be calculated at very early times, we wish to constrain our orbital analysis to only physically associated pairs, and thus will not consider the orbit of a subhalo pair before they are a part of the same FoF group. Specifically, we will consider only the ``post-infall" part of each pair's orbit. 

We define the redshift of ``first infall" as the redshift of the first snapshot where the primary and secondary have the same parent FoF halo, and post-infall is all following redshifts starting with the redshift of first infall. 

Figure~\ref{fig:example-orbits} presents a set of example orbits, which shows the wide variety of orbit-types that can be found in the TNG100 simulation for pairs that were originally selected at $z=1.5$. 
The top panel shows the orbits of 5 pairs that merge, where solid lines show the post-infall parts of the orbit, and dashed lines show the pre-infall portions of the orbit, before the secondary and primary ever share a FoF group halo. 
Even amongst galaxies of the same approximate mass and stellar mass ratio, the spread of merger timescales can be very large, with merger timescales between $\sim1-10\Gyr$ from first infall to merger. 

Some secondary subhalos can experience first infall and, after a pericentric passage, can return to such distances that they are temporarily assigned a different FoF group halo. 
Because all of our mergers occur when the subhalos are in the same FoF group, the
post-infall orbit definition is more robust for considering the full interaction timescales of merging pairs than considering the orbit only when the FoF group of the primary and secondary are the same. 
% a variety of different orbits 

The middle panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:example-orbits} (``Potential Future Mergers") shows the orbits for 3 pairs that are classified as non-mergers, since they do not merge before $z=0$, but which appear likely to merge within a few Gyr past the end of the simulation. 
These orbits can have a variety of orbital periods, and the number of pericentric passages can vary significantly. 
The two lighter blue orbits are very long period orbits with 1-2 pericenter passages in the past $10\,\Gyr$, while the darker blue orbit has a much shorter period with many close encounters throughout, and 3 close passages in just the past $2\,\Gyr$.

The bottom panel shows the orbits of "Fly-by" interactions (non-mergers) that are unlikely to merge in the near future, if ever.  
Note that we do not split our non-merger category into fly-bys and potential future mergers for any of our following analyses, and such distinctions were made only for the purposes of showing the diversity of orbits that pairs selected at the same snapshot may follow.


\subsubsection{Uniqueness of orbits}
A given pair from the \paircat{} may pass our selection criteria at many redshifts. 
Since we collect the full orbit (the separation at every redshift where the primary and secondary both exist) for each pair and each redshift, the orbits that are collected for pairs that pass our selection criteria at more than one redshift will all result in identical orbits. 
% However, we only want to keep a single instance of any given orbit in our catalog. 

To distinguish the collection of unique orbits, each pair is assigned a `pairkey' while constructing their orbit. 
The pairkey is created by concatenating the earliest SubhaloID of the primary and secondary subhalo from the Sublink catalogs, and is unique for each pair of halos. 
After each pair is assigned a unique pairkey, we save the orbit as a function of time only once for a pair that otherwise would have been double/multi-counted in our orbit catalog.

Note that a single subhalo may be a member of many different pairs, but will only have one unique orbit per unique pair.
For example, the primary of a low-mass pair selected at $z=3$ that merges before $z=2$ may be selected via our selection criteria again at $z=1$ with a new secondary companion. 
In this case, both orbits (of the original low-mass pair and the new pair which includes the remnant subhalo from the previous merger) are retained in the orbit catalog, since each orbit is unique.

Removing multiplicity decreases the raw number of orbits collected by collecting an orbit for each pair from the base sample. 
The total number of pairs (including double counting the same pair at multiple redshifts) is 71,429 for low-mass pairs, and 20,824 high-mass pairs. 
However, after removing all redundant orbits, there remain 22,213 low-mass orbits, and 3,029 high-mass orbits.

% For $n_k$ the number of pairs selected at snapshot $S_k$ via the selection criteria/from the base sample, the total number of pairs is given by
% \begin{equation*}
%     \sum_{k=0}^{99}\, n_k
% \end{equation*}
% The total number, and the total number of high-mass pairs is .
% After selecting only unique pairs, there remain 

The collection of all unique orbits constitutes our orbit sample, and is the dataset that will be used for the remainder of the paper.

    %At $z>1$, the fraction of selected pairs that merge before $z=0$ is upwards of 80\% for both low mass and high mass isolated pairs.

    Only orbits with sufficiently short merger timescales will be able to merge at these redshifts.}

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Number of Orbits}
We calculate the number of orbits (or orbits in progress) by selecting all orbits at a given redshift that are post-infall and either pre-merger or non-mergers.
The number of orbits that result in mergers at a later redshift are selected in the same way, excluding the non-merging orbits.
For example, the total number of orbits at $z=2$ includes the orbits of pairs that passed the selection criteria at \textit{any} redshift, provided they achieved first infall at $z\geq2$ and have a merger redshift $z<2$. 
A single pair (or equivalently, the pair's orbit) orbit may meet the conditions of being a "post-infall + pre-merger" pair for $z=0-3$, and will thus contribute to the number of orbits at all redshifts from $z=0-3$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:num-pairs} shows the number of low-mass and high-mass orbits as a function of redshift from $z=0-6$. 
Low-mass orbits (green solid line) are most numerous between $z=1.25-2$, while unique high-mass pairs (pink solid line) are most numerous between $2=0-1$.
The dashed lines show the number of unique pairs that merge prior to $z=0$ for each sample. 
The number of pairs that merge decreases to 0 at $z=0$ since 
%pairs selected at $z=0$ by definition have not merged, and thus will not have the chance to, and 
many pairs that exist at low redshift will have merger timescales longer than the remaining time to the end of the simulation. 

% removed
% The thin dotted green and pink lines show the number of pairs selected at each snapshot individually, so pairs at $z=1$ that do not pass the snapshot-selection criteria at $z=2$ are not included in the number of pairs at $z=2$, but may still be counted at all snapshots where the selection criteria are met. 
% These lines are similar to the pair count lines for low-mass and high-mass pairs from Fig.~1 in~\cite{Chamberlain2024}, but only include the number of major pairs rather than the total number of pairs.

\subsection{Merger Fraction}
We calculate the merger fraction by dividing the number of merging orbits (dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:numorbits}) by the number of total unique orbits (solid lines) at a given redshift. 
As before, an orbit with first infall at $z=2$ and merger at $z=1$ will be included in the merger fraction calculation for redshifts $z=1-2$.

Figure~\ref{fig:fmerge} shows the fraction of isolated pairs of low-mass (green) and high-mass (pink) pairs that merge before the end of the simulation as a function of redshift. 
At redshifts $z>2$, the merger fraction for low-mass and high-mass pairs is greater than $0.9$.
The merger fraction for both mass ranges declines to $0$ at $z=0$, due to the very low fraction of pairs at low redshift ($z<1$) that have short enough merger timescales to merge before $z=0$. At $z=0$, any remaining pairs are classified as non-mergers since they did not merge \textit{$z=0$}.

Note that the merger fraction is a measure of the fraction of isolated pairs that merge before $z=0$. 
It is not, however, a measure of the fraction of \textit{all} low-mass and high-mass pairs that will merge.

\section{Results: The Mass and Redshift Dependence of Merger Timescales}
% The point of this subsection: to show that using the same "observability times" for pairs selected in the same physical separation bins wouldn't work, and that the selection criteria for close pairs should either be scaled with mass and redshift.

Add low/high label somewhere, is the lower sep set to 10kpc?} The distribution of times until merger for low-mass pairs as a function of physical separation at $z=0.5,1,1.5,2,3,\mbox{and }4$. 
    There is a positive correlation between separation at the selected redshift and the time until merger. 
    Of orbit-selected merging pairs at $z=1$, the majority are found with separations $\rsep<100\,\kpc$, and will merge within $3-4\, \Gyr$.

    Similar to the low-mass pairs, there is a positive correlation between the separation of a merging pair at a given redshift and the time until merger, with the lowest separation pairs tending to have the shortest time until merger.

\subsection{Time Until Merger vs. Separation}
% how we calculate for this section
We calculate the time until merger as a function of separation for low-mass and high-mass pairs at 6 different redshifts ($z=0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4$). 
At a given redshift, we identify all merging pairs that are post-infall and pre-merger, then find the associated time difference between the given redshift and the redshift of merger for each different pair.

For example, at $z=1.5$, there are XXX unique low-mass pairs that are post-infall and will merge prior to $z=0$, XXX (XX\%) of them have separations at $z=1.5$ between $\rsep=10-150\,kpc$, while XXX (XX\%) have $\rsep=10-50\,\kpc$. Of those with separations between $10-50\,\kpc$, the number of pairs with times until merger between $0-0.5\,\Gyr$, $0.5-1\,\Gyr$, $1-1.5\,\Gyr$, and $1.5-2\,\Gyr$ is $XX(XX\%)$, $XX(XX\%)$, $XX(XX\%)$, $XX(XX\%)$, and $XX(XX\%)$ respectively. 

% high mass example
Likewise, at $z=1.5$, there are XXX unique high-mass pairs that are post-infall and will merge prior to $z=0$, XXX (XX\%) of them have separations at $z=1.5$ between $\rsep=10-150\,kpc$, while XXX (XX\%) have $\rsep=10-50\,\kpc$. 
Of those with separations between $10-50\,\kpc$, the number of pairs with times until merger between $0-0.5\,\Gyr$, $0.5-1\,\Gyr$, $1-1.5\,\Gyr$, and $1.5-2\,\Gyr$ is $XX(XX\%)$, $XX(XX\%)$, $XX(XX\%)$, $XX(XX\%)$, and $XX(XX\%)$ respectively.
% might put the above in a table with more info? 

% description of figures 
Figures~\ref{fig:timevssep-low} and~\ref{fig:timevssep-high} show the 2D distributions of time until merger vs. separation for low-mass and high-mass pairs. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:timevssep-low}, the time until merger for low-mass pairs is positively correlated to the separation of the pair at each redshift. 

The figures can be used to get approximate `time until merger' ranges for a given separation at a given redshift.

%     The median and 1st-3rd quartile spread of the cumulative time that isolated merging pairs, selected at $z=(1,1.5,2)$, spend with separations \rsep{} greater than $10\kpc$ and less than either \Rphys{} or \Rsc{}.

%     (Top) The median total time spent by isolated merging pairs with separations between $10\kpc$ and \Rphys{}.
%     Low-mass pairs spend a longer amount of time within $\sim200\kpc$ than high-mass pairs at each of these redshifts. 
%     However, high-mass galaxies spend more time at higher separations of $\rsep>200-300\kpc$. This is because the elapsed time is measured starting at the infall snapshot of the pair, and high-mass halos have larger radii, the high-mass halo orbits have a broader distribution of separations that extend to larger separations than those of the low-mass pairs.
%     (Bottom) The median total time spent by pairs with separations greater than $\rsep>10\kpc$ and less than a given fraction of the virial radius ($\rsep/\Rvir<\Rsc$) of the pair, which scales with mass and redshift.  
%     High-mass pairs spend more time within the same scaled separation than low-mass pairs. For example, a high-mass pair selected from the $z=1.5$ sample will spend \kc{XXGyr} within \kc{$1\Rsc\sim XX\kpc$}, while a low-mass pair from the same sample will spend \kc{XXGyr} within \kc{$1\Rsc\sim XX\kpc$}. 
%     Low-mass and high-mass pairs have similar cumulative time profiles as a function of scaled separation, with a roughly constant offset for all scaled separations. 
%     The high-mass pairs spend a median of \kc{$XX\Gyr$} more than low-mass pairs at every scaled separation at $z=1$ and $z=1.5$, and a median of \kc{$XX\Gyr$} more $z=2$.

    The black dashed line shows the Hubble time, which bounds the median time until merger from $z=6$ to $z\sim0.5-0.75$.
    The dotted grey line shows the time to $z=0$ (the Lookback Time) as a function of redshift, which sets the upper bound for the time until merger that a merging pair can have. 
    The median time until merger is similar for low-mass and high-mass pairs, and rises from $z=6$ to a peak at $z\sim0.75$, then decreases to $z=0$.}

    The time until merger increases from $z=4$ to $z\sim0.5-0.75$, at which point the time until merger decreases to zero since all low redshift mergers must have short merger timescales to merge before the end of the simulation at $z=0$.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{About the number of pairs}
Can we say anything about the REASON the unique pairs decreases at low z? Does this plot mean that it's only because things merge and so we lose them? And not that it's driven by mass-accretion thing? I think so.

Need to be careful about phrasing since we didn't actually quantify the number of pairs that leave the sample due to having too large of masses at later snapshots. 

\subsection{About the merger fraction}
Were low-mass pairs expected to have such a high merger rate in isolated environs? 
How do these merger fractions compare to other literature results? 
If we can make comparisons, discuss the differences. 
If we cannot make comparisons, explain why our study is done in a way that makes for comparisons unfair/undoable .

% \subsection{Merger Rates for Dwarf Pairs}
% % - What combination of values best reproduces the merger fraction acquired from the sims?
% % Do you need the scale of merger probability as in Ventou to get the match?
% % Vicente & Casteels 2014 comparison (pair fractions plot)
% \subsection{Pairs of Dwarfs That Do Not Merge}
% % can talk about the unmerged fraction merger rates here
% \subsection{Choosing Samples at Lower and Higher Redshift}
% % can also compare to samples to merger fractions and merger rates chosen at z=1 and z=2 (plots you have already)
% \subsection{Comparing with Merger Rates for Massive Galaxy Pairs}
% % compare to massive pairs in both obs window and merger rate
% % compare back to the assumption of isolation


\section{Summary and Conclusions}

% To do:
% -Sample: starting with FoF group cut and always show the total sample (merged and unmerged) since the unmerged sample is so small
% -Keep Fig 1: (two panels) add in a few more orbits to show the diversity and then have a panel to show one example where you shade everything below 100 kpc to show how the total time at S is computed
% -Keep Figure 2 as is 
% -Remove Figure 3
% -Figure 4: remove normalization of both samples so it's clear that the unmerged ones spend a lot of time at high separation and that they are a small percent of the fraction (put this in discussion or an appendix)
% -Remove Fig 5 and state conclusions in words along with the FoF group selection (most pairs have been in the same group for 1.5 Gyr) (can quote percentages from a cumulative version of the plot, or sum)
% -Figure 6: only show the *full* sample with the FoF group cut 
% check the half mass radius of the most massive dwarfs in your sample and justify 10 kpc by saying you want to be able to resolve twice that
